                                        <h5>Overview</h5>
                                        <p>I redesigned a parent teacher organization’s website that had a 1990's design. After the website creator left the organization, the content managers struggled to update it due to its complexity and their lack of technical knowledge. It was eventually abandoned in favor of a Facebook group. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>To solve this problem, I advised them to migrate the website to a platform and design that was simple to manage, and provided guidelines to make management easier. I used market research, content inventory, stakeholder interviews, and UX best practices to create an attractive and useful redesign.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div class="col-md-6">
                                        <h5>Process</h5>
                                        <p>I interviewed the stakeholders to understand their vision for the website (to disseminate information and encourage participation in activities), their audience (members of the community), and their reason for redesigning (difficulty in updating content). Based on this, I proposed redesigning the website on a blog platform, as it would allow the content owners to update any part of the website simply by applying a particular category to their posts. For example, by tagging the latest post as "Homepage", it can appear on the homepage's carousel. Furthermore, the content and flow of the new website would have to be well organized and actionable (e.g. an event announcement should provide a a contact/signup link).</p>
                                        <p>In order to create the structure for the new site, I conducted an inventory of the old website and Facebook group's content. Market research of similar websites was used to generate additional useful content categories. A revised content structure was developed, negotiated, and approved, using good information architecture principles and patterns derived from market research. User flows were developed to ensure content writing enabled the desired outcomes for the website.</p>
                                        <p>The website structure was divided into reusable templates, and wireframes were created for desktop and mobile platforms. A website platform and theme that fit the intended design were chosen. Medium and high fidelity prototypes were developed to present options for color and font choices based on the organization’s branding and preferences.</p>
                                        <p>After the creation of the new website, content was migrated. Guidelines were given to the client, detailing the website structure of site content and how to properly create updates, in the interest of maintaining consistency and a good experience.</p>
                                        <p>Bonus: some slight visual enhancements were done to the organizations logo to improve its recognizability. The original logo was also converted to a responsive design for use on the website and other platforms where necessary.</p>
